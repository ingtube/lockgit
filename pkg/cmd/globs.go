const globHelp = `Glob patterns supported are like those found in a .gitignore file.  The following special terms are supported:

  *           matches any sequence of non-path-separators
  **          matches any sequence of characters, including path separator
  ?           matches any single non-path-separator character
  [class]     matches any single non-path-separator character against a class of characters (see below) 
  {alt1,...}  matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches

Character classes support the following:

  [abc]       matches any single character within the set
  [a-z]       matches any single character in the range
  [^class]    matches any single character which does not match the class

Note: It is a good idea to surround glob patterns with quotes to prevent shell wildcard expansion.`
