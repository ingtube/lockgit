	Long: `Add files to the vault, either individually or with a glob pattern.

For each input, if it matches a file exactly, only that single will be added to the vault.  If the input matches a
directory exactly, all files of that directory and subdirectories will be added to the vault, and the glob pattern 
"<input>/**" will be added to the vault.  Otherwise, the input will be interpreted as a glob pattern.

Files and glob patterns added to the vault can be removed with the rm command.

	Example: `  Add a single file called credentials in the current directory:
  lockgit add credentials

  Add all .key files in the src directory and its subfolders:
  lockgit add 'src/**/*.key'`,
